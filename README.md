# IntoTheDeep
By: David Jackson


This repo holds only the source code for a prototype video game made in the Unty game Engine. The game is in it's mid stages of development with most of the functionality being completed, with a few more milestones to be finsihed.


Into the Deep was initally -and still is- a side project of mine that I sought to create during my studies at university, where the premise is yet another RTS Dungeon Devling game. In the current stage of development, the game created procedurally genrated dungeons and combat rooms, where the player can take part in a turn-based combat against a varied enemy and skill system. Including the ability to traverse the dungeon and encounter shifting events, ranging from positive or negative ideals -including varying types of comabt encounters. With this the player manages their fear and horror levels while encountering the stresses within the dungeon, by upgrading their equipment and skills at the town, and prepare for the next delve by stocking on supplies ranging from potions to ammo for whatever weapons the player may take in.
